# Fluid Simulation 3D Manual
This file contains all the valuable information about what you need to install and run the simulation.
> [!CAUTION]  
> The project is CPU-intensive. We have simulated 50,000 particles on an AMD Threadripper (Version coming) and an Nvidia GeForce RTX (Version) in Release mode, achieving 50-60 fps.
> Depending on your hardware, managing this number of particles may be challenging. The system has a minimum cap of 2 fps, and frame rates below 40 fps may result in buggy simulations for large particle sizes.

## Installation guide
The project is very simple to get started with. Most libraries and dependencies are already in the project files.
But for a list on [Dependencies](#dependencies) and [external Libraries](#libraries), click the link on them or scroll down till you find the header.

To get started you need both Visual Studio and CMake 3.2 or newer. Make sure the Visual studio version can handle C++ 20.
