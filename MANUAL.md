# Fluid Simulation 3D Manual
This file contains all the valuable information about what you need to install and run the simulation.
> [!CAUTION]  
> The project is CPU-intensive. We have simulated 50,000 particles on an AMD Threadripper (Version coming) and an Nvidia GeForce RTX (Version) in Release mode, achieving 50-60 fps.
> Depending on your hardware, managing this number of particles may be challenging. The system has a minimum cap of 2 fps, and frame rates below 40 fps may result in buggy simulations for large particle sizes.
